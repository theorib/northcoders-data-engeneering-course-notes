1. Analythical problem solving
2. Technical communication
3. Good engineering practices
4. Non-technical communication

### A Day in the life
- 08:30 - 08:45 | Prep/notes reading
- 08:45 - 09:45 | Lecture
    - Introduction to new concepts
    - All lectures are on zoom
    - All in the calendar
- 09:45 - 17:00 | Sprint
    - Set challenges to practice new concepts
    - Not actually a race
    - some solo, some pair

### What is hardware
- The physical tangible parts of a computer

### What is software
- the code!
- set of instructions to carry out a task
- programs that run on your hardware

### What is an operating system
- software that manages computer resources for other software
- the bridge between hardware and software
- allows us to write nice code without having to deal with the complexity of interacting directly with hardware
- It abstracts away a lot of common tasks necessary to run most software allowing them to interact with the hardware and letting programmers focus on the problems they want to solve, not on lots of smaller hurdles along the way
- An OS abstracts away a lot of common tasks necessary to run most software allowing them to interact with the hardware and letting programmers focus on the problems they want to solve, not on lots of smaller hurdles along the way
- unix-based
