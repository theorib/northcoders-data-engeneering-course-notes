# Interview Prep
## Take Home
- more about the final outcome
- more polish expected
    - README
    - Tests
    - Documentation
    - Readable Code
    - Clean Design
- don't make poor technical choices to show off things you know

## Live Test
- more about thought process
    - ask them questions about the specs
    - involve the interviewer in big decisions
    - use them as human google
    - go with a process mindset, you don't need to finish the task but go through it thoroughly
    - get credit for mentioning HARD THINGS while DOING easy things
    - **if you are taking a shortcut EXPLAIN you are taking a shortcut and HOW you would do it in the real world** such as I would add X or Z feature to this but it will take too long
- expect mistakes and not mind them


See yourself as a solution to their problem
- find out what that problem is

## Guidelines
- Avoid yes/no answers, always add examples, context, and details
    - Yes, I love working with XYZ because, [it helped me solve some issue...], I found X feature really useful, because...
- in advance, prepare mini stories and drop them in if you see a good opportunity


## Questions you don't know the answer?
- Show the process of how you'd learn it
- Can I ask you questions?
- Can I look at the docs with you?



## HOMEWORK
- write 12 mini stories talking about tech you worked with, learned and played already
